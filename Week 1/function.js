function welloHorld(){
    
    console.log("Wello Horld"); //Make sure that is before the return value 
    return "Wello Horld"; //anything after return doesn't print
}

welloHorld();

console.log(Math.random()*4); // a decimal number between 0 and 4

//return is for the function only
//when outside of the function, if u want to print out something, use console.log().
